Compatibility
As the target market is the connected and hurried population, the site will be developed
using the mobile-first approach. For this reason, only mobile models will be made.
On tablet and desktop, the site will have to adapt, but these formats are not a priority, so
the developer defines the layout.
● The whole site will have to be responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
● The pages will have to pass W3C validation in HTML and CSS without errors.
● The site must be fully compatible with the latest desktop versions of Chrome,
Firefox, and Safari.
